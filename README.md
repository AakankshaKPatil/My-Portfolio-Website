# About my first project on GitHub.
"This is my first project on GitHub."
Portfolio Website is a project developed using HTML, CSS and typed.js which is basically representing my portfolio about what i have done so far.
This is my first solo project in which i have tried to develop it and to add it in my Github account as a Repository.
Thank you!!
